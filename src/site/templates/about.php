  <h1>About the Project</h1>
  <p class="lead">We know tomorrow will be different from today. We know the future will require new skills, new knowledge and new ways of doing things. And it will also need old wisdom.</p>
  <p>Nature has sustained itself for 3.8 billion years. Nature looks complex, yet behind this complexity lie simple principles which enables life to adapt and thrive.</p>
  <p>Biomimicry is the study of these principles &#8211; nature’s operating system. These principles applied to human design can have a transformational impact. Until the Wright brothers observed how turkey vultures fly in crosswinds, they could not solve the challenge of keeping planes upright on a windy day. Without turkey vultures there might be no planes and no easy international travel.</p>
  <p>Become a Natural Entrepreneur. Learn how to harness the wisdom of nature to build the future of tomorrow.</p>
  <h2>Engaging Schools</h2>
  <p>Natural Entrepreneurs is a European funded project encouraging more students to use biomimicry as a fundamental research tool. It offers an opportunity to explore how biomimicry can tackle the sustainability challenges facing Europe today and presents the applications of biomimicry design as desirable, viable solutions. It encourages students to work collaboratively across Europe and instils a greater sense that Europe can successfully transition to a sustainable future.</p>

  <p>Biomimicry is a growing field &#8211; companies large and small are using it to hone their services, improve design and reduce the environmental impact of their products. The potential of biomimicry as the foundation for designing our future offers opportunities for business, society and everyone. Natural Entrepreneurs allows students to engage with this process and learn how to actively participate in the development of a green economy.</p>
